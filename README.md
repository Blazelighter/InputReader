# Overview

This program demonstrates a basic understanding of Java by creating a window that feature a very basic
gui that displays input from the user. This file can be run from TestInput.java without any issues.

Right now, there are two possible functionalities of the window, displaying either the last key pressed,
or the directional input using wasd (shown using numpad notation). You can uncomment the code there to
toggle which functionality it currently has.
